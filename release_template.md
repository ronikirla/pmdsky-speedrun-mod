Both of these patches have to be applied on a European ROM. The US Codes patch makes the Wondermail System utilize the US version of codes, but **it still has to be applied on a European ROM**.
Credits to reserve_cat from the PMD Speedruns Discord for the BAHAMUT Header Fix Patches.

Both .xdelta and .bps patch files are provided.
The .xdelta files are to be applied with xdelta, while the .bps are to be applied with flips.

To install:

If using Flips:

- Acquire a clean European ROM of PMD Sky (note: if using a rom named BAHAMUT, use the BAHAMUT_Header_Fix patch first).
- Acquire Flips from [here](https://www.smwcentral.net/?a=details&id=11474&p=section).
- Launch Flips and select Apply patch.
- Select the patch that you want to apply, then the ROM to apply that to (**make sure you are viewing all file types**), and then the name of the newly generated ROM file.

If using xdelta:

- Acquire a European ROM of PMD Sky (note: if using a rom named BAHAMUT, use the BAHAMUT_Header_Fix patch first).
- Acquire xdelta. You can get it from multiple places in various forms. [Here](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/)'s a GUI version if you're unsure on which to get.
- Use xdelta to apply the patch to the ROM.
